# wasm_sorting #

wasm_sorting is a web project that compares the speed of sorting
algorithms written in rust and compiled to WASM (WebAssembly) with 
the speed of those same algorithms written in JavaScript. 

## Access ##

The project can be accessed at TBD

## Contributing ##

Pull requests are welcome. Here are some basic guidelines that should be followed:
1. Improvements to existing algorithms and new algorithms are both welcome
2. If you implement a new algorithm, implement it in both Rust/WASM and JavaScript.
